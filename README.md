## Updates in This Fork

This fork of the [arc-dataset-collection](https://github.com/your-original-repo-link) repository includes the following modifications:

* **Latest Versions Only**: Replaced all older dataset versions with their latest available versions.
* **Unified Naming**: Removed version suffixes (e.g., `_v2`, `_v3`) from file and directory names for clarity and simplicity. All files now reflect the most up-to-date version by default.

997M -> 952M: delete blank space in json.

952M -> 830M: packing arc-heavy to jsonl and compress to zip.
