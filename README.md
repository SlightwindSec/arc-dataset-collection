## Updates in This Fork

This fork of the [arc-dataset-collection](https://github.com/your-original-repo-link) repository includes the following modifications:

* **Latest Versions Only**: Replaced all older dataset versions with their latest available versions.
* **Unified Naming**: Removed version suffixes (e.g., `_v2`, `_v3`) from file and directory names for clarity and simplicity. All files now reflect the most up-to-date version by default.
* **Simplified Structure**: The repository structure has been cleaned up to reduce redundancy and make it easier to use the most current datasets without confusion.

These changes are intended to make it easier for users who only need the most recent versions of the ARC datasets.
